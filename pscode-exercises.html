// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(if number is divisible by 2 print Even
if number is not divisible by 2 print odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Read numbers 7,12,18,5,3
b) what is the average of 7,12,18,5,3
Add the five numbers together
Count the number of numbers
Divide the sum of the five numbers by the number of numbers (count)
c)what is the minimum number out of 7,12,18,5,3
For each number in the five numbers, return the lowest number
what is the maximum of 7,12,18,5,3
For each number in the five numbers, return the greatest number 
d) The avarage of Read numbers is: 9
the minimum is: 3
the maximum is: 18
